### 👋 Hi there! I'm Raheel Jamshaid, a passionate software engineer with 3 years of hands-on development experience. I specialize as a full-stack developer, having embarked on my coding journey with Python. Early on, I explored the realms of game development, mastering Pygame and Tkinter to fuel my love for creating immersive experiences.

🚀 My journey into the world of object-oriented programming led me to Java, where I honed my skills by implementing data structures and creating the whimsical 'Waly's Walk' game using  JFrame except this have made student managment backend using Spring boot – all available for exploration on my GitHub.

🌐 As technology evolved, so did my expertise. I seamlessly transitioned into the dynamic realm of JavaScript, embracing the MEAN stack and React Native. With Flutter gaining prominence, I eagerly immersed myself in the framework, showcasing my dedication through 4 months of proven success as a junior Flutter developer.

💼 Beyond my professional endeavors, I've spent two years freelancing, crafting projects with finesse in React and Flutter. Currently, my focus lies in the fascinating universe of Next.js, harnessing the power of TypeScript to build robust and scalable web applications.

📚 Continuous learning is my mantra, and I'm always thrilled to take on new challenges. Check out my GitHub repositories to witness my coding odyssey and feel free to connect! 🚀
